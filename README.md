# Awakeman! 
Source files and bits of the Awakeman webcomic - https://awakeman.com.

So far, it's just the source code for #27 - Walk in the Park. 
Try this:

    go get github.com/DrJosh9000/awakeman/e27
    $GOPATH/bin/e27
    
You should now be playing!
The web version is available using GopherJS.
   
(This isn't the original source code for what's on the site. 
I decided to refactor it all into an engine - AwakEngine! - and the rest.
More improvements to come!)
